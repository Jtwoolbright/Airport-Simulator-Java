# Summary
  The goal of this project was to simulate an airport runway with two different types of planes, takeoff and landing. Only one plane was
  allowed to be on the runway at a time, and landing planes were to be prioritized based off of the amount of fuel left in their tanks. 
  Statistics were to be printed at the end of the simulation as to how many planes took off or landed, average wait times for each plane,
  etc.
